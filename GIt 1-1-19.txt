Git stash
===========
This is used to freeze the git in its current state so that we can continue with some other activites.

If the develoepr has some unfinished work that he wants to leave for now and he wants to work on a new functionality code development then he can send the files into the stash area.All the files moved into the stash area will not be touched by git until they are popped out of the stash area

1 To stash the files present in stagging area
  git stash

2 To stash the files present in stagging area and untracked section
  git stash -u

3 To stash the files present in stagging area,untracked section and   .gitignore
  git stash -a

4 To see the list of stashes
  git stash list

5 To unstash the latest stash
  git stash pop

6 To unstash an older stash
  git stash pop stash@{stashno}


Note: .gitignore is used for storing info about private files that we don't want git to access but .gitignnore file itself will move into the stagging area,local repository and remote repository

To prevent .gitignore from being accessable by git we can use
 git stash -a


Tagging in Git
====================
Tags are used for placing books marks on the commit hisotry
This is used for identifying the important commits that are available
They contain info about who created the tag when it was created and why it
was created

Git supports 2 types of tags
--------------------------------
1 lightweight tag
2 annoted tag

1 To create a light weight tag
  git tag tagname

2 To see the list of all the tags

Note: tags are by default created only for the latest commit

5 To create a tag for an older commit
  git tag -a tagname -m "some message" older_commitid

6 To delete a tag
